## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- A local server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP).
- A modern web browser.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
- Git (optional for cloning the repository).

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/jewellery-shop-website.git
   ```

2. Move the project to your server's root directory:
   - For XAMPP: `htdocs` folder.
   - For WAMP: `www` folder.

3. Import the database:
   - Open `phpMyAdmin`.
   - Create a new database (e.g., `jewellery_shop`).
   - Import the `jewellery_shop.sql` file from the `database` folder.

4. Configure the database connection:
   - Open `config.php`.
   - Update the database credentials (e.g., `host`, `username`, `password`, `dbname`).

5. Start your local server and open the website:
   ```bash
   http://localhost/jewellery-shop-website
   ```
